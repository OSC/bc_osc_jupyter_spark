      This describes how the cores and memory are divvied up on the node
      (*useful to reduce memory allocated for each worker*). Should be a
      multiple of the number of cores on the node you chose above. Do **NOT**
      exceed the number of cores on the node.
  node_type:
    widget: select
    label: "Node type"
    help: |
      - **any** - (*28 cores*) Use any available Owens node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) Use an Owens node that has 1.5TB of
        available RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 16 of these nodes on
        Owens.
    options:
      - [ "any",     ":ppn=28"         ]
      - [ "hugemem", ":ppn=48:hugemem" ]

      This is typically used for `.collect` and `.take` operations that require
      a large amount of memory allocated (> 2GB) for the driver process.
