An interactive app designed for OSC OnDemand that launches a Jupyter Notebook
server and an Apache Spark cluster within an Owens batch job.

## Prerequisites

This Batch Connect app requires the following software be installed on the
**compute nodes** that the batch job is intended to run on (**NOT** the
OnDemand node):

- [Lmod] 6.0.1+ or any other `module purge` and `module load <modules>` based
  CLI used to load appropriate environments within the batch job before
  launching the Jupyter Notebook server.
- [Jupyter Notebook] 4.2.3+ (earlier versions are untested but may work for
  you)
- [OpenSSL] 1.0.1+ (used to hash the Jupyter Notebook server password)
- [Apache Spark] 2.1.0+

[Apache Spark]: https://spark.apache.org/
[Jupyter Notebook]: https://jupyter.org/
[OpenSSL]: https://www.openssl.org/
[Lmod]: https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod

## Install

Use Git to clone this app and checkout the desired branch/version you want to
use:

```sh
scl enable git19 -- git clone <repo>
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

You will not need to do anything beyond this as all necessary assets are
installed. You will also not need to restart this app as it isn't a Passenger
app.

To update the app you would:

```sh
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git fetch
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

Again, you do not need to restart the app as it isn't a Passenger app.
