      This describes how the cores and memory are divvied up on the node
      (*useful to reduce memory allocated for each worker*). Should be a
      multiple of the number of cores on the node you chose above. Do **NOT**
      exceed the number of cores on the node.

    help: |
      - **any** - (*28 cores Owens*, *40 cores Pitzer*) Use any available Owens or Pitzer node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores Owens*, *80 cores Pitzer*) Use an Owens node that has 1.5TB of
        available RAM as well as 48 cores, or a Pitzer node that has 3TB of available RAM as well as 80 cores. 
        There are 16 of these nodes on Owens and 4 on Pitzer.

      This is typically used for `.collect` and `.take` operations that require
